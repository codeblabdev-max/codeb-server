# CodeB Agent Analysis - 49 Agents in 7 Batches

I will now execute a comprehensive analysis of your project using the CodeB Agent system with 49 specialized agents.

## Analysis Structure:
- **Batch 1**: 4 Domain Leads (Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure, Quality)
- **Batch 2-3**: 11 Specialists (React, API, DB, WebSocket, Podman, etc.)
- **Batch 4-7**: 33 Workers (Individual file processing)

## Analysis Scope: $ARGUMENTS

Let me start the 49-agent analysis:

1. **Phase 1: Orchestrator Planning**
   - Scanning project structure
   - Identifying file types and dependencies
   
2. **Phase 2: Domain Leads (Batch 1)**
   - Frontend Lead: React/Next.js components analysis
   - Backend Lead: API and database analysis
   - Infrastructure Lead: Docker/Podman analysis
   - Quality Lead: Dependencies and test coverage

3. **Phase 3: Specialists (Batch 2-3)**
   - Running 11 specialized agents for deep analysis

4. **Phase 4: Workers (Batch 4-7)**
   - Processing individual files with 33 worker agents

5. **Phase 5: Report Generation**
   - Aggregating results
   - Saving to .codeb-checkpoint/

Executing the analysis now...
