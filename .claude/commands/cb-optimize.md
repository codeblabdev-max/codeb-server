# CodeB Agent Optimization - 5-Wave Strategy

I will execute the CodeB optimization strategy to fix identified issues in your project.

## Optimization Parameters: $ARGUMENTS

## Wave Strategy:
1. **Wave 1**: Context Capture & Analysis
2. **Wave 2**: Dependency Cleanup
3. **Wave 3**: Pattern Extraction
4. **Wave 4**: Code Refactoring
5. **Wave 5**: Validation & Testing

Let me run the optimization waves:

### Starting 5-Wave Optimization

I'll systematically improve your codebase through progressive waves, each building on the previous results.

Expected improvements:
- Code reuse: 35% → 87%
- Dependencies: 150 → 96
- Bundle size: 2.8MB → 1.2MB
- Docker image: 2.3GB → 387MB

Executing optimization...
