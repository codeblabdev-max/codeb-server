# CodeB Agent Pattern Management

I will manage reusable patterns in your codebase using the CodeB Agent system.

## Pattern Operation: $ARGUMENTS

### Pattern Management Options:

**If "extract"** - Extract patterns from current codebase:
- Scan React components for common patterns
- Analyze API endpoints for repeated structures
- Identify database query patterns
- Find utility function patterns
- Save to .codeb-checkpoint/patterns/

**If "apply"** - Apply patterns to codebase:
- Load pattern library
- Apply to matching code sections
- Ensure consistency across project
- Update imports and references

Let me execute the pattern operation...
